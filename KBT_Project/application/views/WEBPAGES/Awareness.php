					Disability: An individual's disability can play a major role in his/her life: whether it is positive or 
					negative. But overcoming the challenges and developing confidence is vital and admirable. As a 
					society, it is our utmost duty to allow people with disabilities to experience a life they deserve. 
					We are all different but very much alike at the same time.

					Our Volunteers visit   villages of West Bengal. They identify person with disability and organise 
					meeting with villagers to make them aware that differently abled person are as important citizen 
					as any normal person. WE try to make easier for the people with disabilities and the society to 
					develop empathy for one another. Disability awareness helps in subsiding the stereotypical 
					mindset of the society, hence providing vast opportunities for everyone to get involved in 
					creating a positive, inclusive society for all.
