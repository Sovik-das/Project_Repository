					It is a moral duty of us to take care of the elderly. Being a responsible person we should know how to take care of old people. Our parents or elders sacrifice their golden days with a smiling face in shaping our life. During their old days, they also want support, love, and care from us. So we need to provide assistance to them during their old days. But unfortunately, today's youths are seen ignoring their moral duties. Some of us consider our parents a burden for them at their old days and prefer to keep them in old age homes. This is very unfortunate.

						Importance of Elderly Care Services. Old age is a sensitive phase; elderly people need care and comfort to lead a healthy life without worries and anxiety. Lack of awareness regarding the changing behavioural patterns in elderly people at home leads to abuse of them by their kin.
