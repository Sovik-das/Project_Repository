						Dropping out of school has serious consequences for students, their families. Students who decided to drop out of school face social stigma, fewer job opportunities, lower salaries, and higher probability of involvement with criminal activities. The dropout rate of girls in India is very high. According to the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), 62.1 million children are out of school in India. Looking after the younger siblings, early marriage, lack of safety in school and low aspirations related to girls' education are some of the vital reasons that leads them dropping out. It is often seen that they drop out of schools and take up odd jobs as child labourers to support their family financially.
